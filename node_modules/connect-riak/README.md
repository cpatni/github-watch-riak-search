### Installation

    npm install connect-riak

### Usage

``` js
var express = require('express'),
  RiakStore = require('connect-riak')(express); // both express and connect will work

var app = express.createServer();

app.use(express.cookieParser());
app.use(express.session({ secret: "s3cr3t", store: new RiakStore(options) }));

```

### Options

All `options` will be passed into a new Riak client â€“ unless the `client` is explicitly defined:

``` js
var db = require('riak-js').getClient(),
  store = new RiakStore({ options.client: db });
```

Other options include:

 - `bucket`: The bucket where to store the sessions, defaults to `_sessions`.
 - `reapInterval`: How often old sessions should be wiped out. Must be a number > 0.
